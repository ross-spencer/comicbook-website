      <div class="p7">With the vast number of comics available we could complete a study of the artwork, looking at how
         it varies over the decades. We could also catalogue this information thus creating a directory of artists, publishers and
            their corresponding illustrations. <b>Comparison of Art - </b>There is a large body of comic book artist talent. Because of
               this there are a large number of varying styles, stories and concepts. Completing a study of the artwork within comuc books would
                  give us the opportunity to look for trends over the decades along with correlations with specific artistic revolutions for that period.
                     <b>Directory - </b>During the research for this prototype it was discovered that not all comic book artists are listed with their creations,
                        notably the Star Trek examples used wtihin a number of these pages do not have any artist affiliated with the illustrations, this could provide
                           another area to research into, in an attempt to discover an artists history and work.</div>
