      <div class="p4">This page opening is taken from a 1974 Star Trek comic. The war in Vietnam ended officially in 1975.
         The value of this page opening then works on many levels. We can see clearly that the advertisment for decals on the right
            hand page of this comic form a very peace oriented protest. On first sight there are 35 patches available, nine are in some way
               carrying a message of peace, others are very patriotic, and some are just for fun. The message from the advertiser is written in slang
                  from the period to attempt to capture an audience. Describing the patches as "dynamite" and "groovy", and also pointing out that refunds are
                     "cheerfully" refunded, almost in a deliberate attempt to avoid conflict but still get their own safeguards across.<p>&nbsp</p>On the other page
                         we have a section from the comic. The scene describes an attack of raven like carnivores on a new planet that our protagonists are currently exploring.
                            All of a sudden residents of the planet come out from a forest hiding to rescue our heros, and although grateful they are quite aware that something is not
                               entirely clear about this race, who for aliens, have human similarities.<p>&nbsp</p>So our second page here has the value of its visual narration. But combined
                                  with our advertisment half way through an intruiging dilemma, by design or not a sense of mystery, of unease is created, and suspense as readers, will carry us through
                                     to the next part of the story.</div>
